Cordova (PhoneGap) 3.0+ Plugin to connect to Google's native Universal Analytics SDK

Prerequisites:
* A Cordova 3.0+ project for iOS, Android, browser (PWA), and/or Windows Phone 8
* A Mobile App property through the Google Analytics Admin Console
* (Android) Google Play Services SDK installed via [Android SDK Manager](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html)

# Installing

This plugin follows the Cordova 3.0+ plugin spec, so it can be installed through the Cordova CLI in your existing Cordova project:
```bash
cordova plugin add https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin.git
```

This plugin is also available on npm if you are using Cordova 5.0+:
```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-google-analytics
```

... OR the Cordova Plugin Registry if you are using a version of Cordova before 5.0 (while it remains open, as it is planning to shut down soon due to the move to npm):
```bash
cordova plugin add com.danielcwilson.plugins.googleanalytics
```

*Important Note* If the latest versions (0.8.0+) of this plugin are not working for you with Android on Cordova 5.0+, please try the suggestions in [Issues 123](https://github.com/danwilson/google-analytics-plugin/issues/123#issuecomment-151145095). Google Play Services has been very confusing to integrate, but in recent months it has been simplified.  This plugin uses the new simpler way (including it as a framework instead of bundling it which can conflict with other plugins bundling it), but if you previously installed this plugin some old files might still be lingering.

The plugin.xml file will add the Google Analytics SDK files for Android, iOS, browser (PWA) and/or Windows Phone 8.  Follow [Google's steps](#sdk-files) if you need to update these later.  Also make sure to review the Google Analytics [terms](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and [SDK Policy](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/policy)

If you are not using the CLI, follow the steps in the section [Installing Without the CLI](#nocli)

Windows Phone users have to manually add the [Google Analytics SDK for Windows 8 and Windows Phone](https://googleanalyticssdk.codeplex.com/) to your solution. To do this, just open your Cordova solution in Visual Studio, and add the [GoogleAnalyticsSDK package via NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/GoogleAnalyticsSDK). This plugin requires v1.3.0 or higher.

# Release note

v1.0.0 -- api change from ```window.analytics``` to ```window.ga```, 'analytics' is deprecated since 1.0.0 and you should use the new api 'ga',
because in the next release we are removing the analytics.

v1.7.x -- since this version there are new parameters in some of the old methods like `startTrackerWithId('UA-XXXX-YY', 30)` 
and this is causing errors for those who are using the ionic 2(ionic-native) or ionic 1 (ngCordova); 
these wrapper interfaces don't have the new parameters at the time we did the changes; so please update you ionic framework to the lastest version.


# JavaScript Usage

In your 'deviceready' handler, set up your Analytics tracker:
* `window.ga.startTrackerWithId('UA-XXXX-YY', 30)` where UA-XXXX-YY is your Google Analytics Mobile App property and 30 is the dispatch period (optional)

To track a Screen (PageView):
* `window.ga.trackView('Screen Title')`

To track a Screen (PageView) w/ campaign details:
* `window.ga.trackView('Screen Title', 'my-scheme://content/1111?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=my-campaign')`

To track a Screen (PageView) and create a new session:
* `window.ga.trackView('Screen Title', '', true)`

To track a Screen (PageView) w/ campaign detilas:
* `window.analytics.trackView('Screen Title', 'my-scheme://content/1111?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=my-campaign')`

To track an Event:
* `window.ga.trackEvent('Category', 'Action', 'Label', Value)` Label and Value are optional, Value is numeric

To track custom metrics:
* `window.ga.trackMetric('key', Value)` Value is optional

To track an Exception:
* `window.ga.trackException('Description', Fatal)` where Fatal is boolean

To track User Timing (App Speed):
* `window.ga.trackTiming('Category', IntervalInMilliseconds, 'Variable', 'Label')` where IntervalInMilliseconds is numeric

To add a Transaction (Ecommerce)
* `window.ga.addTransaction('ID', 'Affiliation', Revenue, Tax, Shipping, 'Currency Code')` where Revenue, Tax, and Shipping are numeric

To add a Transaction Item (Ecommerce)
* `window.ga.addTransactionItem('ID', 'Name', 'SKU', 'Category', Price, Quantity, 'Currency Code')` where Price and Quantity are numeric

To add a Custom Dimension

* Key should be integer index of the dimension i.e. send `1` instead of `dimension1` for the first custom dimension you are tracking.
* e.g. `window.ga.addCustomDimension(1, 'Value', success, error)`

To set a UserId:
* `window.ga.setUserId('my-user-id')`

# Example use ionic 2

```javascript
  initializeApp() {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      // Okay, so the platform is ready and our plugins are available.
      // Here you can do any higher level native things you might need.
      StatusBar.styleDefault();
      Splashscreen.hide();
      
      GoogleAnalytics.startTrackerWithId('UA-00000000-0')
        .then(() => {
          console.log('Google analytics is ready now');
          //the component is ready and you can call any method here
          GoogleAnalytics.setAllowIDFACollection(true);
        })
        .catch(e => console.log('Error starting GoogleAnalytics', e));      
    });
  }
```

# Installing Without the CLI <a name="nocli"></a>

Copy the files manually into your project and add the following to your config.xml files:
```xml
<feature name="UniversalAnalytics">
  <param name="ios-package" value="UniversalAnalyticsPlugin" />
</feature>
```
```xml
<feature name="UniversalAnalytics">
  <param name="android-package" value="com.danielcwilson.plugins.analytics.UniversalAnalyticsPlugin" />
</feature>
```
```xml
<feature name="UniversalAnalytics">
  <param name="wp-package" value="UniversalAnalyticsPlugin" />
</feature>
```
<a name="sdk-files"></a>
You also will need to manually add the Google Analytics SDK files:
* Download the Google Analytics SDK 3.0 for [iOS](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ios/) and/or [Android](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/)
* For iOS, add the downloaded Google Analytics SDK header files and libraries according to the [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ios/v3) documentation
* For Android, add `libGoogleAnalyticsServices.jar` to your Cordova Android project's `/libs` directory and build path
* For Windows Phone, add the [GoogleAnalyticsSDK package via NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/GoogleAnalyticsSDK)

# Integrating with Lavaca

The `lavaca` directory includes a component that can be added to a <a href="http://getlavaca.com">Lavaca</a> project.  It offers a way to use the web `analytics.js` when the app is running in the browser and not packaged as Cordova.

* Copy `AnalyticsService.js` to your Lavaca project (I create a directory under `js/app` called `data`).
* In your config files (`local.json`, `staging.json`, `production.js`) create properties called `google_analytics_id` (for the Mobile App UA property) and `google_analytics_web_id` (for the Web UA property) and set the appropriate IDs or leave blank as needed.
* In any file you want to track screen views or events, require AnalyticsService and use the methods provided.

```javascript
var analyticsService = require('app/data/AnalyticsService');

analyticsService.trackView('Home');
```

# Browser (PWA)

For browser (PWA), people who want to use the plugin in a website that has already integrated google analytics needs 
to make sure that they remove the google analytics snippet from the head section of the page and change the global `ga` 
object name to something else. The plugin uses `nativeGa` instead. This can be changed by the following code.

```js
// insert this in your head
<script>
window['GoogleAnalyticsObject'] = 'fooGa';
</script>
```

The plugin will pick up the new name.
